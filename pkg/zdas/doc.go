// Package zdas implements the Ziti Device Authentication Service: an
// OIDC-compliant authorization server that sits between OpenZiti tunnelers
// and an upstream IdP, injecting device-specific claims into JWTs so that
// each device a user enrolls from gets a unique Ziti identity.
//
// # Embedding
//
// Two levels of the package are supported for embedding in other Go
// applications. Both are covered by the compatibility promise below.
//
// The full service: [NewHandler] (or [NewServer]) with a [Config] mounts
// the /authorize, /callback, /token, and discovery endpoints on the
// embedder's mux. [WithProvisioner] and [EnrollmentProvisioner] let the
// embedder own user lookup and identity creation. [WithKeySet] and
// [WithStore] let several replicas behind a load balancer share signing
// keys and in-flight enrollment state, with the per-replica exceptions
// listed on WithStore; package zdastest provides a conformance suite for
// [Store] implementations.
//
// The provider layer alone: [NewOIDCProvider], [NewGitHubProvider],
// [UpstreamProvider], [UpstreamIdentity], and [ProviderRegistry] can be
// used without any of the device-enrollment handlers by an application
// that only needs to federate login to an upstream IdP. The embedder
// builds the redirect with AuthorizeURL (or AuthorizeURLWithPKCE for
// OIDC), and on callback turns the code into an [UpstreamIdentity] with
// ExchangeAndIdentify (or ExchangeAndIdentifyWithPKCE). Nothing in that
// path depends on a session store, a Ziti controller, or ZDAS
// configuration.
//
// # Compatibility
//
// Exported identifiers in this package are treated as a public API.
// Struct fields are only added, never removed or retyped; new fields are
// optional and default to the previous behavior. Interface methods are
// only added when every implementation in this package gains them at the
// same time, and embedders that implement [UpstreamProvider] or [Store]
// themselves should expect to add new methods on upgrade. Query parameters that
// tunnelers send to /authorize are only added, and unmodified tunnelers
// keep working without them.
